# Adding new formulas
## Conventions to stick to
Please stick to some pattern when adding new formulas:
- The following information must be given
	- The name
	- The actual formula with a short expanation of the variables used
	- A short description of the use case and laws derivable from it
- A derivation of the formala is nice to have for understanding but not
mandotory
- The formulas must be ordered alphabetically
## How to hand in new formulas
