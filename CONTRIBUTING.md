# Adding new formulas
## Conventions to stick to
Please stick to some pattern when adding new formulas:
- The following information must be given
	- The name
	- The actual formula with a short expanation of the variables used
	- A short description of the use case and laws derivable from it
- A derivation of the formala is nice to have for understanding but not
mandotory
- The formulas must be ordered alphabetically
## Coding conventions
Each new formula gets it's own subfile in the ```formulas``` directory.
Orient yourself at the ones already given there.
Include as shown already in the text by creating a new section
and then including the subfile.
## How to hand in new formulas
Use ```git-send-email``` to send the patch to
```albertsch@posteo.de```
or open a merge request.
